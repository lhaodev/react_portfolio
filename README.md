# react_portfolio

This application was built using React and component state and router.  The application has three pages, the first page and also the landing page is About Me page, where has my simple introduction. The second page is Portfolio page, where I listed some of my projects with a screenshot of the each project and link directly to the GitHub repo. The last page is Contact page, and I listed three social media platforms I use frequently and feel free to reach out to me.
